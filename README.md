# netsec_fall2017_Lab2_TCP
Transport layer protocol which similar to TCP.
The protocol initiates a session before any data is sent and ensures the data arriving in order without any duplication. The protocol can distinguish the data between two different session and can tear down a session after all data is delivered. Based on the protocol, we wrote the handshake for the connection establishing. And we also realized sending error-free data and the way to handle error.
It can transmit data stably.
